# Brandbook OpeNN Source Club

This project presents the brandbook of our OpeNN Source Club community, which reflects our mission, values, and how we want to interact with the outside world. Let's start with the most important thing — why we exist.  

Our mission statement is as follows: "Real projects and a cool community through open source." We are inspired by the open source culture, and for us the key values are communication, open exchange of experience and knowledge. We are creating an environment where everyone can participate in open source projects, gain their first development experience, launch their own project and find like-minded people.

Let's move on to the visual heart of the brand — our logo. It consists of two key elements: an abstract symbol resembling the letter "S" and a text field with the name opeNN-source-club. It is important to understand the rules of its use: there are basic and long versions of the logo — you can use the one that fits the format. There is a positive version (on a light background) and an inversion (on a dark background). The critical security field is the space around the logo (I've marked it with a dotted line), which protects it from visual noise. The size of this field is one third of the height of the logo (x/3).  

Now let's talk about how to use the logo. A white background is the preferred medium for all positive versions of the logo. The negative version (also known as inversion) is mainly used when the positive version is technically impossible. And most importantly, pay attention to the abbreviation "NN" in the word opeNN. It should always stand out with a contrasting purple corporate color — this is our visual accent reflecting the location of the club – Nizhny Novgorod, respectively.

As we know, color reflects emotion. This palette is designed to be modern, technological and at the same time friendly. The main line includes four colors that are recommended to be used as a priority: our main color is purple, which is used for accents, logos and important elements; deep black, for text and main blocks; dark gray, for backgrounds and minor elements; light gray, for separators and auxiliary elements. The palette can be expanded for gradients or other combinations, but you must use at least two colors from the main line to maintain brand awareness.  

We have selected two free fonts that match perfectly and are suitable for different tasks. Jost is our main font. It's modern, slightly geometric, and very readable. Jost in the Regular font is for headings and accent texts, and in the Bold font is for even stronger accents and first—level headings. Manrope is our typesetting font. It is ideal for large amounts of text, whether it's articles, posters, or documentation. Manrope in the Regular font is for the main text, and in the ExtraBold font is for small headings and important statements.

We have provided additional fonts that serve as a spare typeface or to create special accents. This is an Inter font: Inter ExtraBold — used for accent texts and headings when you need to add dynamics; Inter Regular / Italic (also known as italics) — used for voluminous texts, as well as for decorative elements. Italics are ideal for quotes, captions, or highlighting keywords. These fonts do not replace the main typographic system, but complement it, giving us flexibility in design, especially in digital formats or when working with limited resources.  

To make our brand not only recognizable, but also emotionally saturated, we have developed examples of visual ideas. These are not strict rules, but a variant of decorative elements that can be freely used to design events, social networks, presentations or websites.

And now — the most pleasant part.: what our brand looks like in the real world. This slide shows mockups of the dark version of the merch — zips and caps. The zipper uses an inversion of the full version of the logo; the cap has a large, minimalistic version of the logo.  

And finally, a light version of the merch. Here we use a positive version of the logo — a rather bright purple with an emphasis on the abbreviation NN. This version is more friendly and cheerful.
